Target applications include driving resistive, inductive and capacitive loads such as motors, magnetic deflection, transducers, and programmable power supplies.  For optimum linearity, especially at low levels, the output stage is biased for Class A/B operation by using a thermistor compensated base emitter voltage multiplier circuit.
